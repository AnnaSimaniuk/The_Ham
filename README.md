# Landing Page - The_Ham

The landing page is designed to demonstrate the power and flexibility of custom JavaScript animations. All animations, transitions, and interactive elements on the page are hand-coded using pure JavaScript. This approach allows for complete control over the animations and provides a smooth and engaging user experience.

For convenience, the project is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://annasimaniuk.github.io/The_Ham/).
